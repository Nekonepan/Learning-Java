# ☕ Learning Java

Welcome to **Learning-Java**!  
This repository contains my personal notes, practice codes, and small projects as I learn the fundamentals and object-oriented concepts of **Java programming**.

## 📚 Purpose

I created this repository to:
- Document my journey of learning Java from the basics to more advanced concepts.
- Store my experiments, exercises, and small projects for future reference.
- Build a solid foundation in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** using Java.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

Some of the topics I’ve learned or am currently working on include:
- 🧩 Java fundamentals (variables, data types, control structures, methods)
- 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
- 💾 Basic I/O and file handling
- ⚙️ Packages and modular Java structure
